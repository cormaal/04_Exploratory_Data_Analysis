# Principles of Analytic Graphics

## Principle 1: Show comparisons

- Evidence for a hypothesis is always relative to another competing hypothesis
- Always ask: "Compared to What?"

## Principle 2: Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure

- What is your causal framework for thinking about a question?

## Principle 3: Show multivariate data

- Multivariate = more than 2 variables
- The real world is multivariate
- Need to "escape flatland"
